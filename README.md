# JQueryProject
This project covers the concepts of HTML, CSS and JQuery (AJAX function) and will involve communication with the server and capturing the response from the server.

Concepts involved:<br>
a) Jquery Ajax: Method defined that reaches out to the url of spring application and based on the response (success, error) tries to perform operation on frontend.<br>
b) Spring: Spring Controller with request mapping /response/ returns different values based on algorithm.<br>

Steps in executing this project:<br>
a) Launch the Spring Application. It will be launched on port 8080 <br>
b) Open the home.html page and try to click on the page -- different images will appear based on the response sent from the spring application.
